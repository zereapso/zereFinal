          <h1>Knife</h1>
          <div class="details">
            <h2>Hunting knife or ax</h2>
            <p>Using a knife as an ax to cut trees for a fire is difficult, but using an ax as a knife is as easy as shelling pears. Therefore, we would advise you to think about taking an ax with you!</p>

          <h1>Flint</h1>
          <div class="details">
            <h2>Flint</h2>
            <p>Of course, on a desert island you need something to make fire. Some people talk about matches, others about a lighter. But matches can break or get wet, and the lighter can run out of gas. Therefore, flint and steel would be an ideal option!</p>

          <h1>Raincoat</h1>
          <div class="details">
            <h2>Raincoat tent</h2>
            <p>This is a universal thing that will save you from the rain in any case. It can be used as a raincoat, which is not surprising, and as a tent! This is an excellent military item that has saved more than one military man or hunter from colds, insects and other troubles.</p>

          <div class="details">
            <h2>Fishing gear</h2>
            <p>Of course, you could take a fishing rod to the island, but a much better choice would be a net that works great during high and low tides, or even better a harpoon, which can also be used as a spear.</p>

          <h1>filter</h1>
          <div class="details">
            <h2>Water filter</h2>
            <p>As you know, the sea is salty, so drinking sea water is not only not tasty, but simply disgusting and, moreover, harmful.
              Therefore, a great idea for the fifth thing you need on a desert island is a filter!</p>

            <p>In case a ship or plane flies by somewhere in the distance. After all, as we remember, saving drowning people is the work of the drowning people themselves.</p>
